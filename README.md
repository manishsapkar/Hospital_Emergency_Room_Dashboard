Project Title: Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard â€“ Excel Visualization Project

This project presents an interactive Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard built entirely using Microsoft Excel. It provides comprehensive insights into patient data, wait times, satisfaction scores, and daily operational trends for the month of October.

ðŸ“Š Key Dashboards & Visuals Included:
1. Day-wise Patient Satisfaction Score:
  A dynamic area chart displays daily satisfaction scores, highlighting patient experience variations throughout the month. Peaks and dips help to identify days of concern and high performance.

2. Daily Average Wait Time:
  Another area chart tracks how average wait times fluctuate daily. It pinpoints bottlenecks and helps identify days requiring workflow or staffing improvements.

3. Daily Patient Volume Trend:
  This visual shows daily patient inflow. By identifying busier days, hospital managers can plan for resource allocation and better staff scheduling.

4. Main Summary Dashboard:
  Total patients: 431
  Average wait time: 36.67 mins
  Patient satisfaction: 4.72/10
  Gender distribution, timely service (On-time vs Delay), and referral department insights
  Admission vs Non-admission percentages
  Age group distribution of patients

ðŸŽ¯ Objective:
